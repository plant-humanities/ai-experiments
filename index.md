De I Discorsi Di M. Pietro Andrea Matthioli Sanese, specifically La quale contiene il Primo, & Secondo libro · Volume 4, is part of an influential series expanding on De Materia Medica by Pedanius Dioscorides, a cornerstone of ancient pharmacology. This volume, focusing on the first and second books of Dioscorides’ work, addresses the properties and uses of natural substances, particularly plants, in medicine. Pietro Andrea Matthioli, a distinguished Renaissance physician, enriched the classical text with his commentary, blending ancient knowledge with contemporary medical practices to provide a comprehensive resource for early modern healthcare professionals.

This [volume](iframe1/gotopageid/PP9) exemplifies Matthioli’s detailed approach to documenting medicinal plants and their applications. His commentary explains Dioscorides' original descriptions, adds insights from his medical practice, and includes practical advice on preparing and using remedies. The text is meticulously organized and supplemented by two extensive tables: one summarizing the entire volume’s content and another serving as a quick reference for treating various illnesses. Illustrated editions enhanced the work’s value, offering detailed depictions of plants to aid in identification and practical application.

Matthioli’s commentary bridges the gap between ancient traditions and Renaissance innovations, making De Materia Medica relevant for its time and cementing its status as a foundational text in medicine and botany. His work reflects the intellectual spirit of the Renaissance, where classical texts were not merely preserved but expanded upon with new observations and applications. This volume, like the series as a whole, served as an essential resource for physicians, naturalists, and apothecaries, reinforcing Dioscorides’ enduring legacy in the history of medicine.

The book includes an [engraved portrait of Matthioli](iframe1/gotopageid/PA16-IA94).  These were often included in editions of his commentary on De Materia Medica. Such portraits were a common feature in Renaissance books, particularly for authors of significant works like Matthioli's, serving both as a tribute to the author and as a symbol of authority and credibility.

The intricate frame and decorative elements surrounding the portrait suggest the esteem in which Matthioli was held during his lifetime. The inclusion of heraldic imagery, cherubs, and allegorical figures likely emphasizes his contributions to medicine, botany, and science, aligning his work with both scholarly and noble pursuits.
