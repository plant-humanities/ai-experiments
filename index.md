# Experiments with AI and Historical Texts

This website presents the findings from an informal investigation into the application of Generative AI for analyzing selected historical texts in the field of botany. The primary goal of this exploration was to assess the capabilities of modern AI tools, as they exist in late 2024, in processing, interpreting, and extracting meaningful insights from botanical works of historical significance.

By focusing on historical botanical texts, this investigation sought to understand the extent to which AI can bridge the gap between centuries-old writings and contemporary scientific understanding. The study evaluated the ability of these tools to accurately interpret complex botanical descriptions, identify species from historical illustrations, and contextualize the information within the framework of Renaissance and early modern botanical knowledge. Ultimately, this exploration serves as a benchmark for how effectively AI can contribute to the study of historical botany at this point in technological development.

The works included in this exploration are shown below.  Clicking on the title link will take you to a page listing the experiments performed on the work.

*De I Discorsi di M. Pietro Andrea Matthioli* is a 16th-century commentary on Dioscorides' *De Materia Medica*, a foundational text in pharmacology and botany. Written by Italian physician Pietro Andrea Matthioli, the work expands on Dioscorides' descriptions by including observations of plants discovered during the Renaissance, along with detailed botanical illustrations. It served as both a medical reference and a botanical guide, blending classical knowledge with contemporary discoveries to advance the understanding of plants and their medicinal uses.

[The herball, or, Generall historie of plantes](herbal-gerard)

*The Herball, or, Generall Historie of Plantes* by John Gerard is a landmark English herbal first published in 1597, offering detailed descriptions of hundreds of plants alongside woodcut illustrations. Drawing heavily from earlier works by European botanists like Dodoens and Lobel, Gerard's book emphasizes the medicinal properties, cultivation, and uses of plants, including many found in England. Widely read in its time, it became a standard reference for gardeners, physicians, and botanists, though it was later revised and expanded by Thomas Johnson in 1633 to correct errors and enhance its scientific accuracy.
