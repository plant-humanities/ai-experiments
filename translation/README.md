The text in the image is in Italian and seems to be a dedication or preface from an old manuscript or book. I will transcribe and translate it into English for you. Let’s start with the transcription:

**ALL’ILLUSTRISSIMO  
SIG. GIO. ALVISE BERNARDO,  
PATRITIO, SENATOR VENETO,**  
Del già Illustrissimo Signor GIO. BATTISTA,  
Signor mio osservandissimo.  

Essendo la vita nostra la più cara, & pregiata cosa che in questo Mondo godiamo (quando massime la godiamo in sanità, & buono stato) è ben bisogno, & ragionevole in ogni caso, sempre attendere con ogni mezzo, & in che maniera ella si possa conservar lungo tempo. Per le due molte, & più volte havendo, per la professione, che io tengo, per la relatione de’ studio intendenti, consederato, & conosciuto per vero, che non v’è libro, ne volume, che in sè medesmo migliori modo di conservar l’huomo sano; se non uno, che io fin hora habbia veduto, si è quello di Dioscoride, interpretato dall’Eccellentissimo, & non mai abbastanza lodato M. Pietro Andrea Matthioli…

**Translation:**

**TO THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS  
MR. GIO. ALVISE BERNARDO,  
PATRICIAN, VENETIAN SENATOR,**  
Of the formerly Most Illustrious Mr. GIO. BATTISTA,  
My most esteemed Sir.  

Since our life is the most dear and precious thing we enjoy in this world (especially when we enjoy it in health and good condition), it is necessary and reasonable in every case to always strive, by every means, to preserve it for as long as possible. For many reasons, and several times, given my profession, and through my studies and conversations with learned individuals, I have considered and recognized as true that there is no book or volume that better explains the way to keep a man healthy than one I have thus far seen, which is that of Dioscorides, interpreted by the Most Excellent and never sufficiently praised Mr. Pietro Andrea Matthioli…

**TO THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS  
MR. GIO. ALVISE BERNARDO,  
PATRICIAN, VENETIAN SENATOR,**  
Of the formerly Most Illustrious Mr. GIO. BATTISTA,  
My most esteemed Sir.

Since our life is the most dear and precious thing we enjoy in this world (especially when we enjoy it in health and good condition), it is necessary and reasonable in every case to always strive, by every means, to preserve it for as long as possible. For many reasons, and several times, given my profession and through my studies and conversations with learned individuals, I have considered and recognized as true that there is no book or volume that better explains the way to keep a man healthy than one I have thus far seen, which is that of Dioscorides, interpreted by the Most Excellent and never sufficiently praised Mr. Pietro Andrea Matthioli (done with great method and easily comprehensible for every reader). This book not only teaches the great and simple qualities of herbs and other things but also explains how they can assist in maintaining and restoring our health. I have taken it upon myself to bring this work to print, as it has been printed many times before.

It is evident that studies of this kind are valued and sought after in France, Spain, Flanders, Germany, England, Poland, and elsewhere. Over forty years ago, when I was residing in the great city of Anatolia (now Istanbul), a Milanese doctor informed me that in the Ottoman seraglio, women often requested to read and interpret such works by candlelight. Even the Turks, each day, wanted a reading from this book. This fact alone is enough to demonstrate the book’s infinite value, and why it is highly sought after in libraries.

All day long, scholars eagerly look for works of this nature. For these reasons, I have decided to have it printed, ensuring the greatest possible diligence and precision, and to make it accessible to those practicing this profession. I hope the results will bring great satisfaction to everyone. Just as precious stones must be adorned with beautiful settings, so must great works of learning be treated with excellence. To this end, I humbly place the name of Your Most Illustrious Lordship at the forefront of this book, trusting in your generosity to receive it.

Let the excellence and greatness of the work speak for themselves, and let its great usefulness justify its recommendation to you. Therefore, I entrust this volume to Your Most Illustrious Lordship, as it will find no more fitting a patron than yourself. You come from an ancient lineage and are admired for your great virtues, rare qualities of spirit, and love for the arts and sciences. Indeed, even your most illustrious ancestors in Venice were esteemed and favored. Your father was renowned for his service to the state and his honorable bearing. He was a model of loyalty and wisdom, entrusted with significant responsibilities, which he fulfilled to the great satisfaction of the Senate.

Your Most Illustrious Lordship has succeeded in bringing equal distinction to your noble lineage. I trust you will regard this dedication not as flattery but as a sincere acknowledgment of your great virtues and unparalleled reputation. With this, I conclude, placing myself in your service and under your most gracious protection.

**Your devoted servant,**
